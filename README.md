# Predicting How Fish Swim with Neural Networks

***Note: This is an old project from Spring 2021 in CS 510 (Introduction to Artificial Intelligence).***

### Project Description

We investigate how neural networks can be used to predict a fish’s thrust and phase difference given the fish’s flapping frequency, distance between fins, and lateral force.
